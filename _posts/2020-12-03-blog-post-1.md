In this post I would like to talk about the evolution and its relationship to local optimum concept!

Headings are cool

Let's first talk about the concept of the local maximum.
The maximum of a function is the greatest value that the function can produce in its output range. In order to find the maximum of a function, one solution is to provide different inputs and check the outputs. If the obtained output is more than the maximum value that has been seen so far, the obtained value would be considered as the maximum among all the inputs provided by the time. The explained algorithm to find the maximum alters the input value in each step to slightly change the output and moves toward the overall maximum of the function. The input values continue to change until the next input values result in lower outputs. This algorithm is called gradient descent. However, this algorithm has a serious drawback. Consider the following graph:
