## Abstract
High concentrations of fine-grained particles in the air can adversely affect human health.
To control it, the European Union has undertaken several strategies, such as the introduction of certain particle concentration thresholds allowed in populated areas, or limitations for vehicle access. However, many cities in Germany are unable to follow this legislation and control the particle emission because it is hard to attribute the pollution to a clear source.
Therefore, it is important to understand the dynamic process of the fine-grained particles
distribution and the reasons the emission occurs. In this project, we aim at designing a
system that provides the human analyst with descriptions about polluted areas within a city, and potential causes.
